# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code.

## Adding a changeset

To add a changeset, run `pnpm changeset` in the root of the repository. This will prompt you to select which packages have changed and what kind of change it is (major/minor/patch).

## Releasing

The release workflow automatically:

1. Creates a "Version Packages" PR when changesets are merged to main
2. When that PR is merged, publishes the packages to npm

For more info, see [the changesets documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).
